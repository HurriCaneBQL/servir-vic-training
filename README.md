# servir-vic-training

This repository contains training material (presentations and tutorials) and processing scripts and test data on how to setup the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model.

If using any of these training materials or scripts, please cite: Markert,K.N., E.C. Adams, B.R. Rushi, F. Mitheu, E.R. Anderson, A.I. Flores, W.L. Ellenburg (2017). Building capacity in eastern Africa for hydrologic modeling . *The Earth Observer*, *In preparation*.

The training setup model is for the Nyando River Basin in eastern Kenya. The Nyando Basin is a small watershed that drains into the Winam Gulf of northeastern Lake Victoria.

This training was created as a NASA capacity building effort through the NASA SERVIR Science Coordination Office (www.servirglobal.net) for the SERVIR-Eastern & Southern Africa partnering institution, the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD, http://www.rcmrd.org/)

Please contant me at kel.markert@nasa.gov if you have any questions regarding the use of training materials or processing scripts.

## REQUIREMETS:
- The training requires a Linux operation system to run the VIC model. The training materials have been tested on Ubuntu 14 and Ubuntu 16 operating systems.
- The Python and other processing scripts require specific software and Python packages to be installed on the system for the training to work. If you are going to use the training materials and Python scripts please follow the instructions within the installation guide (servir-vic-training/documents/software_installation.pdf)

The training was conducted within a Virtual Machine (https://goo.gl/DiQr7w) using the Oracle VirtualBox software. If you want to setup the VIC model and walk through the training on your local linux installation, please see the installation guide materials referenced in the requirements section.
