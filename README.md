Training materials for the VIC hydrologic model setup.

This repository contains training material (presentations and tutorials) and processing scripts and test data on how to setup the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model.

The training setup model is for the Nyando River Basin in eastern Kenya. The Nyando Basin is a small watershed that drains into the Winam Gulf of northeastern Lake Victoria.

This training was created as a NASA capacity building effor through the NASA SERVIR Science Coordination Office (www.servirglobal.net) for the SERVIR-Eastern & Southern Africa partnering institution, the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD, http://www.rcmrd.org/)

Please contant me at kel.markert@nasa.gov if you have any questions regarding the use of training materials or processing scripts.
